### Mon, 21-Sep-2020 ###
- Finished the "Employee performance" page
- Created the "waste prodcution" page
- Created the "bin frequency" page
- Added a scroller to every bar charts (the purpose a scroller is to give user the control to zoom in/out the graph, this is useful when the data to be shown is too many)
- We can now use BootStrap in our HTML (the reason is because BootStrap makes styling a HTML page easier)
- Instead of refreshing the entire page when a link is being clicked, now, the app only refreshes some components of the HTML page (with this, the application runs faster, and the code looks neater)

### Tue, 22-Sep-2020 ###
- Fixed the bug where bin markers don't load ocassionally
- Added clear bin button (this button will turn the "bin_fullness" property to 0, and turn the bin marker's colour to green)
- Added "edit profile" page (half done)

### suggestions
# 1) texts in user profile block at home page not bounded, they are out of the block
# 2) maybe it is better to select fonts with slightly rounded edges since the blocks in home page has round corners
# 3) links are not navigating properly, once i sign in I'm brought to home page, but it is stated as profile in the link
# 4) If i press home again when I'm at home page, I'm brought to admin page?????

# 5) I think the employee performance graph looks pretty good
# 6) sorting options should be available in admin, i.e the bins section
# 7) What is the account used for admin? right now if i log in using my account I can access admin and home page, which
     should not be the case
