### Mon, 21-Sep-2020 ###
- Created the "Employee performance" page

- Style all the HTML pages with BootStrap (Bootstrap is a CSS framework)
- Instead of refreshing the entire page when a link is being clicked, now, the app only refreshes some components of the HTML page (with this, the application runs faster, and the code looks neater)

### Sat 17-10-2020 ###
- Added CSS framework to prompt messages (to make it more interactive)
- In the big map, if the user click the "finish" button, the user will be directed to the main page
- Implemented a full procedure of clearing a bin
	a.) select bin (will render the bin collecting route)
	b.) accept job (render a bigger map on the home page) (still has to implement bin locjing mechanism)
	c.) Finish job (will check if the user really cleared the bin, if so, take user to home page)
		* Note that checking if the user really cleared the bin is impossible to implement at this stage, because we are not working on real user location

### next to do ###
- the rate of every bin getting filled
- fix the bug where the bin popup closes by itself every time bin marker is being updated


External libraries:
1.) Mapbox GL -> for the map
2.) Bootstrap -> CSS
3.) Anychart.JS -> data visualization
4.) JQuery -> DOM manipulation
5.) Alertify -> alert prompt & confirmation prompt CSS

Limitations:
1.) Browser's zoom size should be fixed to 125% in order to have a proper interface.
2.) Switching between different pages too fast in admin page could render an incorrect UI.

Errors:
- Creating an assginment will return internal server error, however, the assignment instance itself will still be successfully created in the DB
