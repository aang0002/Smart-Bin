### Mon, 21-Sep-2020 ###
- Finished the "Employee performance" page
- Created the "waste prodcution" page
- Created the "bin frequency" page
- Added a scroller to every bar charts (the purpose a scroller is to give user the control to zoom in/out the graph, this is useful when the data to be shown is too many)
- We can now use BootStrap in our HTML (the reason is because BootStrap makes styling a HTML page easier)
- Instead of refreshing the entire page when a link is being clicked, now, the app only refreshes some components of the HTML page (with this, the application runs faster, and the code looks neater)
